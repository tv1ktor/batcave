# List of things that I want to improve/do

1. TODO: `link-parser` - When submiting a link through telegram's {AddLink} flow, schedule a worker that would
                   parse provided link, retrieve title, short description, and may be do something like Telegram's quick view.
                   Also tagging system for this stuff would be just amazing! Imagine sending github link, and bot will tag it as (code, ruby, framework, etc) based on the language used in repo, and the fact that this is github.

2. `Bot engine` - Move Telegaram bot code/models/gems into separate engine.
3. `Bot flow gem` - Improve and extract bot flows into a gemfile. This would actually be usefull for people who create bots.
                    Simple ui, with powerfull and fast to get started API.

4. `Make bot public` - I think since I am building this bot for myself, it might help to solve same problems for other people.
                       May be `AddThough` wouldn't actually, but other things might.

## Following are scatches...
...on what I want or might do with portfolio part and things i think would be great to do for the bot part
