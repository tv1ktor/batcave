<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I think it's time I create my portfolio website.</h1>

[![Ruby Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-community-brightgreen.svg)](https://rubystyle.guide)

I like the idea when one person is able to create outstanding web application using one server(port(almost ðŸ˜…)) and one language (even though I like many languages).

Therefore for my portfolio and curiosity I will dig into Rails + Hotwire. I think it will be fun. If you never a project where these technologies were used - you are welcome! (drop me a message if you have ideas on how to make it even better)
